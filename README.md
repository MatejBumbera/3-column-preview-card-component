## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox

### What I learned

My major learnings were 
 - media query
 - overflow property

I used media query for the site to be responsive. It's useful when we want to change property depending on screensize \(in my case border-radius\)

I needed to use overflow property because after my content got wrapped, it got cut because it didn't fit on a website.
